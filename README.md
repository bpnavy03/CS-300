# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
# The problem we were solving with the projects in this course were to design, develop, and implement a program
# that loads an input file, displays courses, and lists course prerequisites using a particular data structure.
#
# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
# I approached the problem using a binary search tree due to it's ability to display contents
# in an alphanumeric order.
#
# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
# I overcame roadblocks that I encountered by using the debug tool, research error codes, and watching
# (and rewatching) videos posted my Professor Ling
#
# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
# The concepts I learned and development in this course have expanded my approach on handling large datasets.
# In my career, I interact with large datasets, and this course has given me the tools and abilities to re-assess
# how I interact with this data.
#
# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
# The work in this project has helped solidify my programming by writing codes that are maintainable, readable, and 
# adaptable. This was an aspect I struggled with at the beginning of my studies, but have been improving on steadily.
# Proper use of in-line comments and generous use of white-space has made my code significantly better overall.
